PostHog Event Debugger does not collect, store, transmit, or sell personal data.

All data displayed by the extension is processed locally within the user's browser and never leaves the device. The extension passively observes PostHog analytics events that are already present in the page’s JavaScript context for the purpose of developer debugging.

No data is sent to external servers.
No analytics or tracking is performed by the extension itself.
No personally identifiable information is collected or retained.

Any locally stored data is limited to extension preferences such as UI state and filters.
